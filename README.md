I'm a full stack junior developer, soon to be graduating from Makers Academy, one of the world's best coding bootcamps. Enthusiastic, perseverant and multi-lingual, I bring with me a wealth of transferable skills garnered from over 9 years working in administrative and customer-facing roles in the UK and abroad, as well as the creativity of a professional actor and Classical musician.

As a quick and self-directed learner, I don't balk when approached with unfamiliar technologies because I know I can develop the understanding to get me up to speed. As an avid pair programmer trained in Agile methodology and TDD, I have an adaptive style of working and build robust, clean code, while my attention to detail means that I'm good at spotting bugs.

I'm looking for a junior developer role in a company that will appreciate the unique qualities I can bring, while giving me the opportunity to develop my skills and work within a friendly and committed team.

## Skills

#### Analysis

My methodical mind means that at Makers Academy, debugging is one of my strengths as I am good at examining the stack trace and using visibility gaining techniques to tighten the loop on bugs.

While an HR Officer in Luxembourg, my analytical skills enabled me to massage convoluted data such as employee sickness statistics pulled from a rather temperamental system into a concise and readable format for senior members of staff. 

#### Communication

As a user support worker for Chordify, I was able to pass (often negative!) customer feedback back to the software developers in a friendly manner, while at the same time ensuring that any issues were dealt with. I also had a super friendly attitude towards the users and was good at helping them with their problems. 

My colleagues at Makers Academy have commented that I am brave and always willing to participate in group discussions, share code in group reviews etc. I'm not afraid to receive critical feedback and can communicate what I need.

#### Adaptable team-worker

At Makers, I collaborated closely with different individuals due to rotating pairs and project teams throughout the course. People I worked with noticed that I was a motivating force, ensuring that every member of the group was able to bring forth ideas and be listened to.

As a temp worker, I often worked in many environments, taking on new challenges in a variety of roles. I pick up unfamiliar tasks quickly and integrate easily into a team. As a result, I was frequently invited back to companies I had worked with.

#### Foreign languages

Fluent French and conversational German and Dutch.
