I'm looking for a junior developer role in a company that will appreciate the unique qualities I can bring, while giving me the opportunity to develop my skills and work within a friendly and committed team.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

While working as a waitress, my teamwork skills and can-do attitude were often commented on. In a restaurant, it can be extremely high-pressured and hectic, even if there are no catastrophes to deal with. In such instances, you need to know that your colleagues have got your back and can be depended on to not only perform their own role to the best of their ability, but come to your aid as and when needed. When I was on shift, my colleagues always knew they could fully rely on me for support.

While at Maker's, working on projects, my team-mates noticed that as well as always playing my part, I was a motivating force, ensuring that every member of the group was able to bring forth ideas and be listened to.

#### Analysis

During my work both as an HR Officer and administrative worker for Knight Frank, I often had the opportunity to use my analytical skills to transform data into my meaningful reports for senior members of staff.

My methodical mind means that while at Maker's, I am adept at de-bugging and following the flow of information to find exactly where the problem lies.
